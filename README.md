# The Code Wiki

I, like many a person before me, learned to code, and took notes on the code I learned to use.  Within this file structure is the code I learned to use, plus or minus several years of learning that hasn't made it from physical notebooks into Markdown.


## Current Main Sections

The majority of my coding has been for data science, with occasional forays into using Ruby to assemble websites.  Thus, you'll get to see:

* Python
* SQL
* TBD?
