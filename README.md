# SQL Notes

Hi Cash App folk!

Because NDAs mean I cannot share code I've previously written, I've made a guidebook of best practices and code snippets I've found useful over my career.  I've written this for a layperson, but with links to help reach the next stages of SQL knowledge.

I hope this will be a useful demonstration of my knowledge; at the very least, it's been a great exercise for me to organize some of my thoughts.

Cheers!
